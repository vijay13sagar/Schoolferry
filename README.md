# Schoolferry Project
Me, along with four other interested candidates, connected on LinkedIn and developed our project named “Schoolferry” for a client designing the mobile and web app using React Native and React.js, respectively. App main objective is to make a social network like Uber, but for school children travel, parents can use that to book Bus facility plan based on the distance between the start and school location to be accessible in a 50km radius in Bangalore city, India.
